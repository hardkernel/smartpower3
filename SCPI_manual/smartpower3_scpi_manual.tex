\section{Introduction}

SmartPower3 is a small power supply designed to provide power supply to up to two connected devices and measure and log the connected devices power consumption. The first firmware versions allowed control of the SmartPower3 via devices buttons, rotary encoder and display. As the system became more mature, some users showed interest in remote control of the power supply. New versions added more refined functionality and SCPI (Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments) capability - effectively enabling (at least partial) remote control of the SmartPower3. This manual tries to describe the commands available in SCPI device mode.

For more information regarding SCPI and its usage please see the online specification and description available at:

and other online resources.

\section{Device modes}

The SmartPower3 device can basically be used in two modes - the default original "buttons and screen" mode and SCPI mode. The default (original) mode tries to be compatible in function with the previous firmware version, while SCPI mode allows programming of the device via serial using SCPI commands and (like the default mode) optionally output logging information to WiFi connected UDP target.

The mode is changed via screen and encoder, on the second device screen, near the bottom. The option is (surprisingly) called \verb|Mode| and allows setting two options:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Default - provides re-worked two level serial menu that enables setting SmartPower3 functionality.
    \item SCPI - reserves serial connection for SCPI control of the device.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Commands}

\subsection{Command Syntax}
    Lets start with an example command:
    \begin{verbatim}
        [SOURce#:]CURRent <numeric_value>
    \end{verbatim}
    As you may see, the command consists of a couple of parts, divided by \verb|:| character. In different commands, some of these command parts will be repeated - these divide individual subsystems. They could also be presented in a tree-like structure.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item{} The command is written in upper-case and lower-case letters. These denote the short-form and full-form of the command. The part written in capital letters is the shor-form - when you enter the command, it is necessary to write this part of the command - or the whole command. Apart from this disctinction, the case of the letters does not matter. So it is possible to enter the first segment of the above command in following ways:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item{SOUR}
            \item{sour}
            \item{source}
            \item{SOURCE}
        \end{itemize}
        \item{} The \verb|#| is a placeholder for a number - in this case, a number of the source channel. If ommited, it is automatically expected to be number 1.
        \item{} The \verb|[]|brackets around the \verb|SOURce| indicate that that particular part of the whole command is optional - it is not necessary to write it when entering the command. So the above example could be shorthanded as \verb|CURR <numeric_value>|. But in that case it would apply only to source 1. In order to use source 2, you would still have to use both parts, as the source number is defined in the first part. 
        \item{} The \verb|<numeric_value>| indicates that the command needs some sort of parameter. It's meaning and possible values are usually described at the individual command.
    \end{itemize}

\section{Python Examples}

The power supply in SCPI mode can also be controlled by various VISA implementations. This enables the user to programmatically perform and repeat various test and measurements, that might otherwise be quite complicated or outright impossible with sufficient precision.

The following is a simple example of how the device might be used.

More information on how to use PyVISA can be found at\newline
\href{https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/index.html}{https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/index.html}.

\subsection{Prerequisites}

It is expected that you have Python3, PyVISA and backed installed. We are going to use PyVISA-py for the backend.

The exact steps how to install these prerequisites depend on your selection of operating system and its version. For example, most Linux distributions will have Python installed by default, so its installation might be skipped.

Once Python is installed, you could, for example, install the remaining dependencies for the current user by running the following in terminal:
\begin{verbatim}
    pip install -U pyvisa pyvisa-py
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Connecting to the Power Supply}

The next step is to connect to the SmartPower3 power supply. To do so, please follow these steps:
\begin{enumerate}

    \item Connect SmartPower3 to your computer using serial cable.
    \item On the setting screen, set SmartPower3 to \verb|SCPI| mode.
    \item Open your terminal application and start Python interpreter by typing:\newline\verb|python|
    \item Import PyVISA and connect by typing the following
    \begin{verbatim}
        >>> import pyvisa
        >>> rm = pyvisa.ResourceManager()
        >>> rm.list_resources()
        ('ASRL/dev/ttyUSB0::INSTR')
        >>> inst = rm.open_resource('ASRL/dev/ttyUSB0::INSTR')
        >>> print(inst.query('*IDN?'))
    \end{verbatim}
    The \verb|('ASRL/dev/ttyUSB0::INSTR')| string will most likely be different in your case. You might even have more devices listed, depending on your hardware. That is OK, just select the one that corresponds to your serial connection.
    
    The last command (\verb|print(inst.query("*IDN?"))|) should result in the terminal printing out the power supply identification, which should look similar to 
    
    \verb|Hardkernel Co Ltd,SmartPower3,<mac_address>,Build date: Jul 19 2023 19:32:24|, where \verb|<mac_address>| will be the WiFi module MAC address (a string similar to \newline\verb|94:3C:C6:CC:AA:78|) and the Build date will reflect your current firmware version.
    \item In case the last command didn't produce the desired result and you got timeout error response, there are couple things you can check to remedy the situation:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Check that the device is in SCPI mode.
        \item Check device serial baud rate. It is quite possible that your SmartPower3 is set to a higher baud rate than 9600, which is PyVISA default. To set correct baud rate, you can use the following command:
        \begin{verbatim}
            inst.baud_rate = 115200
        \end{verbatim}
        where \verb|115200| should be changed to the actual value set on your SmartPower3.
        \item It is possible that the response was followed by an empty line. In such a case, there is a mismatch between line endings returned by the device and line endings that PyVISA expects. That can be remedied by issuing the following command:
        \begin{verbatim}
            inst.read_termination = '\r\n'
        \end{verbatim}
    \end{enumerate}
    For more troubleshooting info please see PyVISA documentation available\newline at \href{https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/communication.html\#}{https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/communication.html\#}.
      
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Doing Something Usefull}
Once you have succeded in issuing the identification command and getting a proper response, we can get to something more useful.
\subsubsection{Doing a Voltage Sweep}
Let's suppose that you have just finished a construction of a new hardware device that is supposed to be powered by 12 Volts DC. But you also want to check how the device behaves at a lower voltage, gradually bringing the voltage up from 5V to the full 12V. That could be achieved by the following commands:
\begin{verbatim}
    # by now, you have pyvisa imported and are connected to the device
    import time
    start_voltage = 5
    end_voltage = 12
    inst.write(f'source1:volt {start_voltage}')  # the starting voltage on channel 1
    # uncommenting the next line turns channel 1 on and the sweep is done under power
    # it is advisable to first check the functionality of your program
    # with the output turned off, in case there is a mistake
    # inst.write('output1 on')
    while(start_voltage <= end_voltage):
        print(f'start_voltage = {start_voltage}')
        inst.write(f'source1:volt {start_voltage}')
        start_voltage += 1  # increase the value of start_voltage by 1
        time.sleep(2)  # wait 2 seconds
\end{verbatim}

The example above is rather rudimentary and does not use the possibilities of the device to its full extent.

If you wanted to set values on a finer scale than whole Volts and not use Python float data type - which is advisable, as it can lead to unpredictable results - you could modify the above script as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
    # by now, you have pyvisa imported and are connected to the device
    import time
    start_voltage = 3000  # the value represented in milliVolts 
    end_voltage = 5000  # the value represented in milliVolts
    inst.write(f'source1:volt {start_voltage}mV')  # note the added unit of mV
    # uncommenting the next line turns channel 1 on and the sweep is done under power
    # it is advisable to first check the functionality of your program
    # with the output turned off, in case there is a mistake

\subsubsection{Plotting Power Data From Measurements on Channel 1}
    The \verb|contrib/SCPI_examples| directory of Smartpower3 git repository contains file\newline
    \verb|sp3-scpi-datalogger.py| which does exactly what the subtitle advertises.
    
    But before you use it, you should be aware of a couple of important points:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 
            Check what voltage your device operates on. The file sets output voltage to 5.1V (required for Raspberry Pi 4), so if your device operates on other voltage, change \verb|device_input_voltage| variable in the \verb|run| function to the required value.
        \item 
            The script expects the device to be connected to the first (left) channel.
        \item 
            The script expects that you use Serial connection to your SmartPower3 and it lets you choose your serial device.
        \item
            It asks you how long you want to run the logging - plese enter numeric value, seconds.
        \item
            Before you run the script with your device connected to SmartPower3, please run the script without the device to make sure everything is working as expected, the power is set to correct level etc. Doublecheck everything.
        \item 
            The script saves logged data to intermediate .csv file in the same directory as the script. You might want to use that file for further analysis.
        \item 
            The scrip is pretty basic and definitely can be improved upon - don't hesitate to modify it to suit your needs. But please doublecheck before powering your device.
    \end{enumerate}
    If everything goes well, the script will output window with power plot similar to Figure 1.

            \caption{Script output}
        \end{center}
    \end{figure}
    
    If things don't go as planned, please check the following:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item 
        Check that the device mode is set to SCPI. If not and you try to use PyVisa, you will most likely get complains about read method not having read termination and \verb|>>> Unknown Command <<<|.
    \item 
        Check the device you try to power is connected to the correct channel.
    \end{enumerate}
